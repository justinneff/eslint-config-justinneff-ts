# ESLint and Prettier Presets for Typescript

These are the ESLint and Prettier settings I like to use for Typescript projects.

## Installing

1. Ensure you have `package.json` file
2. Install `eslint-config-justinneff-ts` and it's peer dependencies. (This command works with yarn too)
```
npx install-peerdeps eslint-config-justinneff-js
```
3. Create a `.eslintrc` file in the root of your project that looks like this:
```json
{
	"extends": [
    "justinneff-ts"
  ]
}
```
4. You can also add these scripts to the `package.json` file to give you simple commands for linting and fixing files.
```json
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint .",
  "lint:fix": "eslint . --fix"
},
```
